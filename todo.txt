-position images
-make inter-document links
-come up with css magic (or other) to address the stroke weight difference in small-cap text
-investigate fonts
   -screen optimized serif?
   -go sans serif instead?
   -whatever it is, make sure that all of the fancy characters show
-think about how to display the umlaut on Jötun and Jörmungandr
-should all fancy characters be replaced with html entities?
-go through css and make sure that everything is styled properly
-style hearts, pasts, and fates text under titles
-any images replacable with svg?
-make favicon with red background
-make touch icons with smaller "M" (looks very tight with rounded corners)
-there are a couple of images that need to be cropped (somewhere in hearts/pasts/fates ?)
-there is a blight card image somewhere that has lost its border (prob autocropped too often)
-holy crap... this looks horrible in IE (8 alt least)
